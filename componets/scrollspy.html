        <p>Info:
          The gladiators have called out for help and the gods have answered. The Arena game mode is a brawling deathmatch where your goal is to defeat enemy players and their minions by reducing their side's ticket count to zero. Average game time is around 15 minutes.

          Killing an enemy minion deducts 1 ticket from the enemy tickets.
          Helping a friendly minion reach the enemy portal deducts 1 ticket from the enemy tickets.
          Helping a friendly siege minion reach the enemy portal deducts 15 tickets from the enemy tickets.</p>

          Map Objective:
          Destroy opposing towers, phoenixes, and titan.
          Once you leave your spawn area, you cannot return until you have died and respawed.
